      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();

      const person = {

      // const captain = person;
      // captain.number = 99;
      // console.log(captain);
